Console game of Minesweeper

Welcome to Minesweeper Console App!

Minesweeper is a classic puzzle game where the objective is to locate all the hidden mines in a grid.
The grid is filled with squares that can either contain a mine or be safe.
To locate the mines, you click on the squares and mark them as either a mine, or safe.
If you mark a square as a mine and it is correct, then it will be revealed.
If it is wrong, then you will lose the game.
If you click on a square that is safe, then it will reveal the number of mines in the adjacent squares.
You can use this information to deduce which squares contain mines and which don't.

How to play:
1. Select the operation you want to perform
  - Write a number of one operation that is listed as an output.
2. Decide what move you want to make
  - Write two numbers separated by space in order to play, e.g.: command "0 2" will pick field in the first row(0 index), third column(2 index)
  
  
Good luck!
